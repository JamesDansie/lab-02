            <h3>Code Fellows</h3>
            <p>I recently enrolled at Code Fellows coding bootcamp to make a career change. Prior to that I had worked for about five years a research Engineer at ClearSign Combustion working on low pollution burners. These are burners for refineries and boilers that burn more cleanly than traditional burners. While I was there I started usingn python to clean up and analyze our experimental data. I enjoyed coding and using python more than I enjoyed my normal work, so I decided to make a go at being a coder.</p>
            <h3>ClearSign</h3>
            <p>At ClearSign I designed, tested, and comissioned experimental low pollution burners. What does that mean in english? I made <em>big</em> fire balls. These were cleaning burning, some of the cleanest energy on the planet. They were also unstable at times. It is very unnerving to have a 40 foot fire ball being unstable, with 1/4" steel flexing like a drum. It was a neat technology, but ultimately it was a dead end job, and I would have to move to find a new job. I didn't want to do that, so I decided to go back to school.</p>
            <h3>University of Utah</h3>
            <p>I went to school at the University of Utah, and studied chemcial engineering. I also was a research assistant, and I worked on computer models studying clean coal combustion. In particular we looked at chemical looping as an alternative form of coal combustion. This would allow a more efficient form of carbon capture with CO<sub>blah 2</sub> sequestration. The short version is that "clean coal" is a terrible idea. Just don't.</p>

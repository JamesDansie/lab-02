            <h2>Code Fellows</h2>
            <p>I recently enrolled at Code Fellows coding bootcamp to make a career change. Prior to that I had worked for about five years a research Engineer at ClearSign Combustion working on low pollution burners. These are burners for refineries and boilers that burn more cleanly than traditional burners. While I was there I started usingn python to clean up and analyze our experimental data. I enjoyed coding and using python more than I enjoyed my normal work, so I decided to make a go at being a coder.</p>
